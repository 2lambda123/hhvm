     It might be possible to do decl-diffing on shallow-decls and if they're

     in the case of just one disk file change notification, but worse in the
     case of 5000 since it'd require getting shallow-decls on all of them just
     to compare, even if they weren't actually needed.

     I tried evicting everything but it was far too slow. That will need to be

     I'm rolling out a new feature called "sticky_quarantine"
     which makes some scenarios faster, but at the cost of being
     more exposed to flaws in this [invalidate_upon_change] method.

     Specifically: prior to sticky_quarantine, we'd redecl a file's
     shallow and folded decls every single time we entered quarantine,
     and this masked flaws in the invalidation we do here and now
     upon file change. But with sticky_quarantine, we only redecl
     a file's decls if the pfh_hash has changed, so it no longer
     masks the flaws in [invalidate_upon_change].

     Therefore: if sticky_quarantine, then we'll do the right thing
     upon file change, trusting that the cost of doing the right thing
     is compensated by the increased speed of the common case.
     But if not sticky_quarantine, then we'll stick with the existing
     flawed-but-papered-over behavior. *)

It will also preserve the invariant that all decls in [local] reflect the truth of

2. otherwise, it invalidates any decls associated with the old [decls_reflect_this_file],
sets [decls_reflect_this_file] to the new entry, and invaldiates any decls associated with the new.

     The feature "sticky_quarantine" is used only for the local backend. It uses a different
